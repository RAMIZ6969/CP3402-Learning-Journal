Content Insights

This week focused on the transition from static web design to dynamic Content Management Systems (CMS).
I learned that Joomla operates on a database-driven model where content (Articles) is stored separately from the site's structure (Menus) and presentation (Templates).
This is more efficient than static HTML, as I can update a single template style to change the entire site’s look without rewriting my articles.
I also gained practical experience in CMS file hierarchy, specifically discovering that Joomla 5 requires custom CSS files (user.css) to be located within the /media/ directory structure to render correctly.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights

A major learning moment occurred when my initial hosting account failed security verification.
Instead of stalling, I practiced "professional persistence" by opening a support ticket and communicating with a technician to verify my account manually.
This taught me that troubleshooting in IT often involves navigating administrative hurdles and professional communication, not just writing code.
Additionally, customizing the site branding—such as resizing the SkillSwap AI logo and changing the header background from blue to white—required me to think about "User Experience" (UX). 
Ensuring a platform looks professional and trustworthy is a vital skill for a web developer or data scientist presenting a concept to clients.
