LearnJCU CP3402 Week 1 Lecture Videos

## Estimated Hours
Approximately 2 hours were spent on this practical.

## Content Insights
Through my research into Git configuration, I learned that Git requires a global user identity (email and name) before it allows any commits to be recorded.
This ensures every "save point" has an author for accountability. I also discovered that when using PowerShell, folder paths containing spaces must be wrapped in quotation marks (e.g., `cd "Week 1"`) because the terminal interprets spaces as the start of a new command parameter.
Understanding these small technical details prevented further "fatal" errors in my workflow.
Lastly, I could not get to remove journal.md from my inital repo.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week taught me the importance of documentation and version control as professional skills rather than just academic tasks.
By resolving the `src refspec main does not match any` error, I realized that many technical failures are caused by skipping foundational setup steps (like initializing and committing locally before pushing).
In a professional setting, being able to troubleshoot these terminal-level issues independently makes a developer more efficient.
I have found that my learning process is most effective when I encounter a specific hurdle, stop to research the underlying logic (like Git's identity requirements), and then apply the fix.
